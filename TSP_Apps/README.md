# TSP Apps

Keithley's TSP (Test Script Processor) allows direct control of TSP-enabled instruments via an on-board, user accessable processor.  For our Touch Test Invent &reg; touchscreen enabled instruments, TSP can be used to take further control of the instrument's display and user interface to create mini, instrument specific applications, or Apps.

## About TSP

The TSP language is largely based on Lua 5.0 with instrument specific commands and some features of later Lua versions. [You can read more about Lua here.](https://www.lua.org/) Check the Reference Manual of your instrument for more information on TSP and for the supported, instrument specific commands.
