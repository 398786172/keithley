* **[Three Reasons to Consider Solid State Switching](./Three_Reasons_to_Consider_Solid_State_Switching_Examples)**  
Code examples from the appendices of the white paper "Three Reasons to Consider Solid State Switching" found in the directory or [on tek.com](https://www.tek.com/document/whitepaper/three-reasons-consider-solid-state-switching-your-data-acquisition-system). Examples specifically target the DAQ6510 Data Acquisition and Multimeter System and Series 3706A System Switch/Multimeter. While these examples are intended to be used with the 7710 and 3724 solid state multiplexers (for the DAQ6510 and 3706A, respectively), they can also be used with other multiplexer card models. The biggest difference will be speed; secondary is channel compatibility.
