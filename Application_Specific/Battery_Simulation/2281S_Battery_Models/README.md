## Generating 2281S-20-6 Battery Models

New Models can be generated by discharging a real battery using a Keithley Model 2450, 2460, or 2461 SoruceMeter&reg; Source Measure Unit and the script provided in the [Model Generation Script Folder](./Model_Generation_Script).  There is an instructional PDF included in the folder with the script, please read it carefully as not following the instructions can result in dangerous conditions while discharging your battery, particularly for Lithium Ion based batteries.
